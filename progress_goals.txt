Week1:
- talk with supervisor/get a supervisor
- load data
- decide metadata
- making working tree
-

Week2:
- All models done

Week3:
- 

Preprocessing goals/ideas:
- Add noise to background to blur current background audio (gaussian, sample, etc)
- Change duration of samples used
	- Try loading data in as audio, then cut into x second duration samples, then do mel spect
- Try 1D convolution of FFT instead
- Find more data to ones with current low count
- Trim data for ones with the same
- Research to find pretrained network and attempt to use them
	- Audio network
	- ImageNet
	- ResNet
- Create own pretrained network from previous years and use as starting point
- Use something other than pytorch?



Overall goals:
- tree (Malthe)
- cnn (Jakob)
- nn after cnn (Birk)
